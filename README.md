# Multilayer Perceptron

## Multilayer Perceptron

A *Multilayer Perceptron* (MLP) is one of the simplest deep models. It consists of:
* An input layer: features of the input variable.
* Hidden layers: that compute over the input features; it is important to introduce non-linearlity with activation functions in these layers,
this way the model works as "universal function approximator" .
* Output layer: output of the model.

The following Figure (from: [Neurons in Neural Networks, by Nikhil Bhargav](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/neural-networks-neurons)) shows the model.

We can refer to this kind of architecture as *fully connected layers* because the output of every neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the following layer.

## Model Evaluation

### Forward Propagation

*Forward propagation* or *forward pass* refers to the computation and storage of intermediate variables for a neural network in order from the input layer to the output layer.

Let $\bf{x}$ de the input variable, ${\bf{W}}^{(i)}$ and ${\bf{b}}^{(i)}$ the weights and bias of the $i$-th layer respectively (starting counting from the first hidden layer), 
$\sigma^{(i)}$ the activation function of the $i$-th layer, ${\bf{h}}^{(i)}$ the output of the $i$-th hidden layer and $\bf{o}$ the output of the model. Then, forward propagation
is computed as follows:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\bf{h}}^{(1)} & = & \sigma^{(1)} ( \ {\bf{W}}^{(1)} {\bf{x}} + {\bf{b}}^{(1)} \ ) \\
{\bf{h}}^{(2)} & = & \sigma^{(2)} ( \ {\bf{W}}^{(2)} {\bf{h}}^{(1)} + {\bf{b}}^{(2)} \ ) \\
\vdots & = & \vdots \\
{\bf{h}}^{(L-1)} & = & \sigma^{(L-1)} ( \ {\bf{W}}^{(L-1)} {\bf{h}}^{(L-2)} + {\bf{b}}^{(L-1)} \ ) \\
\bf{o} & = & {\bf{W}}^{(L)} {\bf{h}}^{(L-1)} + {\bf{b}}^{(L)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

### Activation Functions

Some activation functions are:

* *Rectified Linear function* (ReLU):

Defined as
$$\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \max{(0, x)}$$

It retains only positive values, and discard all negavite values their activations to $0$. For positive arguments the derivative of the ReLU
function is $1$ and for negative arguments it is $0$. Although it is not differentiable when $x=0$, by default we use the left-hand-side derivative
and say that the derivative is $0$ when $x=0$.

There exists some variations of this function: *Leaky ReLU*, *parameterized ReLU* (pReLU) and some others.

* *Sigmoid function*:

Defined as
$$\mathrm{sigmoid}(x) = \frac{ 1 }{ 1+\mathrm{exp}(-x) }$$

It squashes any input in $\mathbb{R}$ to some value in the range $[0,1]$ Its derivative can be expressed as

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \ \mathrm{sigmoid}(x) = \mathrm{sigmoid}(x) \left( 1 - \mathrm{sigmoid}(x) \right)$$

When the input diverges from $0$ in either direction, the derivative approaches $0$, and this can lead to a vanishing gradient problem.

* *Tanh function*:

It is the *hyperbolic tangent function*, and it is defined as

$$\mathrm{tanh}(x) = \frac{ 1 - \mathrm{exp}(-2x) }{ 1 + \mathrm{exp}(-2x) }$$

Similar to sigmoid function, it squashes any input in $\mathbb{R}$ to some value in the range $[-1,1]$.

Its derivative can be expressed as

$$\frac{ \mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \ \mathrm{tanh}(x) = 1 - {\mathrm{tanh}}^2(x)$$

Also, when the input diverges from $0$ in either direction, the derivative of the Tanh function approaches $0$.

## Model Training

During training, the model is fitted to a set of data (refered as training data). Model parameters are updated
in order to minimize some loss function, usually we do this with a *Gradient descent* method (the basic optimization
algortihm is *Stoochastic Gradient Descent* or SGD). 

### Loss function

Fitting our model to the training data requires that we define some measure of fitness (or unfitness). Loss functions
quantify the distance between the real and predicted values of the target. The loss will usually be a non-negative number
where smaller values reflect better predictions.

For regression problems, the most common loss function is *Mean Squared Error* (MSE). Let ${\bf \hat{y}}^{(i)}$ be the value predicted by the
model and let ${\bf y}^{(i)}$ the corresponding true target for an observation ${\bf x}^{(i)}$, the squared error is given by
$l^{(i)} \left( \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) = 1/2 {\left( {\bf y}^{(i)} - {\bf \hat{y}}^{(i)} \right)}^2$. The, the MSE is given by

$$L \left( \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} l^{(i)} \left( \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2} {\left( {\bf y}^{(i)} - {\bf \hat{y}}^{(i)} \right)}^2$$

Where ${\bf \theta}$ represent the model parameters and $n$ is the size of the batch.

For classification tasks the *Cross Entropy Loss* is usually used. 

### Back Propagation

The training of a MLP requires a loss function $L({\bf{o}}, {\bf{y}})$ to minimize. This function is defined over
the output of the model and the available data, and to minimize it we use a gradient descent method that requires
to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters of the model (${\bf{W}}^{(1)}$, ${\bf{W}}^{(2)}$,
 ...).

*Back propagation* refers to the method of calculating the gradient of the neural network parameters. This methods
traverses the network in reverse order (from the output to the input layer) according to the *cahain rule* of calculus.

Let $\mathtt{Y} = f(\mathtt{X})$ and $\mathtt{Z} = g(\mathtt{Y})$, where $\mathtt{X}$, $\mathtt{Y}$ and $\mathtt{Z}$ 
are tensors. Then, 

$$\frac{\partial \mathtt{Z}}{\partial \mathtt{X}} = \mathrm{prod} \left( \frac{\partial \mathtt{Z}}{\partial \mathtt{Y}}, \frac{\partial \mathtt{Y}}{\partial \mathtt{X}}\right)$$.

Since we are dealing with tensors of arbitrary (but consistent) shape, here the $\mathrm{prod}(.)$ operator is a multuplication
after the nessesary operation (transposition, swapping position, etc.).

## Computational graphs

*Automatic differentiation* and *computational graphs* profoundly simplifies the implementation of deep model.
