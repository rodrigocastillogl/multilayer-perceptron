## Multilayer Perceptron

A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the simplest deep models. It consists of:
* An input layer: features of the input variable.
* Hidden layers: that compute over the input features; it is important to introduce non-linearlity in these layers, this way the model works as "universal function approximator" .
* Output layer: output of the model.

The following figure shows the model (from: [(Neurons in Neural Networks, by Nikhil Bhargav)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/neural-networks-neurons).

# Forward Propagation

Forward propagation or forward pass refers to the computation and storage of intermediate variables for a neural network in order from the input layer to the output layer.

Let $\bf{x}$ de the input variable, $\bf{W}^{(i)}$ the weights of the $i$-th hidden layer, $\bf{h}$ the output of the $i$-th hidden layer and $\bf{o}$ the output of the model. Then, forward propagation is computed as follows:
